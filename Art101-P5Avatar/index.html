        For this project, I wanted to explore what I could do with coding and how far my current knowledge could get me as I had never created an interactable character before. For this project, I google mapped the directions to destinations that I went to a lot or that I really enjoyed, which included San Jose State University as well as my workplace at the time.
        I took the mappings and then transferred them to a grid where, with the boxes of the grid, it created a pixel art looking avatar. I was satisfied with the avatar but I had to make it special somehow. I used Processing to code the avatar and give it proper form. 
        So in order to make it special, I wanted to have the user be able to interact with the piece, so I decided to make it into a game for the viewer. I learned a lot with this project and I look forward to using that knowledge on future projects.
