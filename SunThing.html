  <p class="sketchDesc">
    "Sun drug" is a concept I thought of when I first started using Processing. Its inspiration was a lesson in my health class at the time of creation, it was regarding drugs (specifically hallucinogens).
    With this, I decided to create a piece that many people can look at, but won't see the same thing and is very difficult to look at. It took me a long time to explore the shapes and sizes I wanted, but eventually I landed on what the piece is now.
    The color being random is meant to replicate the hallucinations that one may sees on hallucinogens. What do you see when you look at it?
