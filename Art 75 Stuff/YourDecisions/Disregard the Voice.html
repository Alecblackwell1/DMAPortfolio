<p>
	You've made the right choice. Disregarding the voice makes you feel a sense of ease, but it's not easy. You go through many hardships trying to overcome the voice. You talk to your parents and friends about how you feel, then you talk to your doctor about how you feel. He gives you options, you decide to try them. So you talk to a therapist, and start to feel better about yourself and start to feel confident in yourself.
