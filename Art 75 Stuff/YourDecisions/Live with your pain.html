<p>
	
	You've decided to live with your pain. The pain has not lessened or gone away, it will be a part of you till the day you die. 
	<br>
	Your family never notices when you go to your room and cry. Your friendship with everyone has not changed, you have friends...but you never feel very close to them. 
	<br>
	You never tell them about the hardships you're going through so it all piles up inside of you, until you can't take it anymore and you start to take out your anger and sadness on the people around you.
