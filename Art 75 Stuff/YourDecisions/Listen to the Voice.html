	You've decided to listen to the voice and stop attempting to find help for what's going on inside you. At first nothing really seems to change. But then you start realizing that you feel distant from others and never feel like yourself. Since you feel so distant from your friends, everything inside you keeps getting piled up and eventually erupts causing what seems like all emotions but anger and sadness to dissipate.
