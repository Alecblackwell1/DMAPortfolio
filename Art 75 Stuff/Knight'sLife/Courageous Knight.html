<p>
	You stay and try to defend the king to the death as is your duty. You are able to take down 10 bandits but one lands a hit on you and your sword arm is sliced so that you cannot use your sword. <br>
	A bandit approaches and delivers a deadly stab to your heart, but your actions gave the king enough time to flee to safety. <br>
	You are remembered throughout history for being a noble and courageous knight who gave his life for his kingdom. You are seen as a legend and a prime example of what a knight should be. There is a statue in the middle of the kingdom in your honor.
