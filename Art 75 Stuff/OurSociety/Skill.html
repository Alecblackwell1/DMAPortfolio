	You have chosen "I like to show other my skill in games or sports"
	<br>
	The potential jobs for this category are taboo as some would say. These types of jobs are becomming more and more common as techonlogy advances. 
	<br>
	Our socity is always online. If you want to show your skill in gaming, then you could start streaming the game on streaming platforms (like Twitch or Youtube). But you could also upload your highlights to Youtube and could potentially get recognized by teams and start a career. 
	<br>
	If you want to show your skill in sports, many teams have scoutings to try to recruit new players. Joining a sports team during highschool could be a good way to get scouted by college teams and from there on be scouted by NFL teams.
	<br>
	Unfortunately these two optinos are very hit or miss. There are many people who try to go into these careers but are not able to make it in the industry. But that doesn't mean that you don't have a chance.
