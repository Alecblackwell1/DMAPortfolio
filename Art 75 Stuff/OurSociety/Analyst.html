	You have chosen "I like to analyze aspects of a game or sport"
	<br>
	Some potential jobs for this category are being an analyst or announcer for a game or sport. Every sport or game has some sort of commentator or analyst. Analysts have major roles in these activities. Teams have their own analysts in order to tell the team what they could do better. They are an integral part of the team. But not only do sport teams have analysts, so do gaming teams. Debatebly they have the same importance as the coach of a team. The analyst rewatches the match over and over again until they are able to communicate to the team as to what they should try to do better. 
	<br>
	There are many people who have this job, but most don't really think about their job. Most would think the jobs are boring and unintersting. But their jobs are, in actuality, incredibly interesting. In order to be an announcer/analyst one must know all aspects of what they are trying to analyze. One cannot be analyst without knowing what to analyze.
