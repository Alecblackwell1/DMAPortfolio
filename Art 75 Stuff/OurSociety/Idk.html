	Don't like any of the choices? Well that's fine. These are simply some options that could help you find what you like in your life and what you could imagine yourself doing for the rest of your life.
	<br>
	In addition to having to find out what you want to do in life, you have to make sure that you're going to be able to enjoy it 10 or even 30 years later. But that's life, we have to keep trying and that is quite unmotivating to most people. Everyone wants to just have their dream job, but reality is disappointing. Most would tell you that as long as you try hard to achieve what you want...you will be able to get it. However, that is simply not true many people work many hours a week in order to achieve their dreams but that doesn't always happen. 
	<br>
	Life is a game of chance, it is a game we all play and one that we have all lost and won in.
