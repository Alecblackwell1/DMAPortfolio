<p>
	You've picked "I like to watch movies", there are many possible fields that you could go into that you may like.
	<br>
	A few are sound design, editing, producing, directing, and camera operator. These are the more common jobs to get in the film industry.
	<br>
	The creation of movies is simply not possible without any of these roles. Every person in these roles are extremely important to the project as a whole. Think about your favorite movie, now think about that movie but without a sound design person, and replace those sounds with free stock sounds found online. Not so great? Well that is just an example of how one role could affect the whole movie.
	<br>
	These jobs are extremely stressful, and demand absolute perfection to create a finished product.
